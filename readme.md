# Date your food
This is an app that helps the users visually decide which restaurant to go to. At the moment the app has the basic functionality to reject or save a restaurant to a favorites list. You get to see one restaurant at a time. Each restaurant is presented as a carousel of pictures that you can navigate bij pressing on the left or the right half of the picture. 
Ideally the app would also have a function to set your preferences and filter the restaurants based on location or diet. But unfortunately that’s a bit complicated at the moment. 

## The feature
As mentioned before, the app only has only the functionality switch between restaurants and save your favorites in a separate list. 

## Let's install and run the app

the first step to use the is, is cloning this repo. You can do this by typing the following command in your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/brightstudent/backend
```

If you're using a mac like me, git will be already installed on your device. You can check this by typing in your terminal: 
```
$ git --version 
```
If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

If you're on a Windows machine, visit <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git> for an installation guide.
